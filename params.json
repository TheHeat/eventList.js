{"name":"Eventlist.js","tagline":"List well formatted events from a publicly shared Google calendar.","body":"eventList is a super-simple to use jQuery function for displaying a list of forthcoming events on your page.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Events are marked up as [schema.org](http://schema.org) events, including ISO 8601 timestamps and whatnot\r\n* eventList generates feed links below the events list\r\n* The list is completely unstyled (feature not a bug)\r\n\r\n## Easy peasy\r\n\r\nGetting eventList up and running is really easy.\r\n\r\n1. Include the script in your head (youâ€™ll need jQuery too of course.\r\n2. Add a div with the id=\"eventList\"\r\n3. Run the function eventList();, passing in the ID for the publicly available Google calendar you would like to display.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"eventList\"/>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n\t$(document).ready(function(){\r\n\teventList('YOUR_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID@group.calendar.google.com');\r\n\t});\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nThe original version of this file was inspired by [this post by Kevin Deldycke] (http://kevin.deldycke.com/2012/07/displaying-upcoming-events-google-calendar-javascript/)\r\n\r\nI've included [autoLink.js] (https://github.com/bryanwoods/autolink-js) which finds and formats links in specified strings. It is cool and made by Bryan Woods.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
