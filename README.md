eventList is a super-simple to use jQuery function for displaying a list of forthcoming events on your page.

## Features

* Events are marked up as [schema.org](http://schema.org) events, including ISO 8601 timestamps and whatnot
* eventList generates feed links below the events list
* The list is completely unstyled (feature not a bug)

## Easy peasy

Getting eventList up and running is really really easy.

1. [Find your calendar ID in the calendar settings page.](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/63962?hl=en) The calendar _must_ be publicly available.
2. [Generate a Google Calender API key](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=calendar)
3. Include the script in your head (youâ€™ll need jQuery and [Autolinker.js](https://github.com/gregjacobs/Autolinker.js) too)
4. Run the plugin on your desired target, passing in the ID for the publicly available Google calendar you would like to display.

```
<div id="target-div"></div>

<script>
	$(document).ready(function(){

    args = {
      key: 'YOUR_GCAL_API_KEY',
      calID: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID@group.calendar.google.com',
      maxResults: 12
    }

    $('#target-div').eventList(args);

	});
</script>
```

### Credits

The original version of this script was inspired by [this post by Kevin Deldycke] (http://kevin.deldycke.com/2012/07/displaying-upcoming-events-google-calendar-javascript/)

I've included [Autolinker.js](https://github.com/gregjacobs/Autolinker.js) as a dependency which finds and formats links, Twitter handles and all manner of things in strings. It is very cool.
