eventList is a super-simple to use jQuery function for displaying a list of forthcoming events on your page.

## Features

* Events are marked up as [schema.org](http://schema.org) events, including ISO 8601 timestamps and whatnot
* eventList generates feed links below the events list
* The list is completely unstyled (feature not a bug)

## Easy peasy

Getting eventList up and running is really really easy.

1. [Find your calendar ID in the calendar settings page.](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/63962?hl=en) The calendar _must_ be publicly available.
2. [Generate a Google Calender API key](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=calendar)
3. Include the script in your head (youâ€™ll need jQuery too)
4. Run the plugin on your desired target, passing in the ID for the publicly available Google calendar you would like to display.

```
<div id="target-div"></div>

<script>
	$(document).ready(function(){
	 $('#target-div').eventList('YOUR_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID@group.calendar.google.com');
	});
</script>
```

The original version of this file was inspired by [this post by Kevin Deldycke] (http://kevin.deldycke.com/2012/07/displaying-upcoming-events-google-calendar-javascript/)

I've included [autoLink.js] (https://github.com/bryanwoods/autolink-js) which finds and formats links in specified strings. It is cool and made by Bryan Woods.
